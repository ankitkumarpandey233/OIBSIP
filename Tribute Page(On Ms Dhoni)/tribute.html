        <strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong> or as he is commonly known as <strong>MS Dhoni</strong> is an Indian
        cricketer who represents India on the International stage. On the domestic level, Dhoni plays first-class
        cricket for Jharkhand.
        <br /><br />
        In 1995, he joined the Commando cricket club and stood behind the stumps for them for the next three years. He
        was then picked for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship in the 1997/98 season and performed well.
        In 1998, Dhoni started to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. During his time at the CCL, Deval
        Sahay would gift him fifty rupees for every 6 that he scored in Sheesh Mahal tournament cricket games. Sahay
        then pushed for Dhoni’s selection in the Bihar team.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="high">IPL Career</span>
        <br /><br />
        Dhoni’s services were contracted by the Chennai Super Kings for US$1.5 million in IPL’s inaugural season in
        2008. He was the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions. Dhoni captained Chennai Super
        Kings to victory in 2010 and 2011, 2018 and 2021 Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 and 2014 Champions
        League T20 titles.
        After the CSK was banned for two years, Dhoni was subsequently bought by Rising Pune Supergiant for US$1.9
        Million in 2016. He was the captain that year but after his team finished in 7th place he was replaced by Steven
        Smith.
        MS Dhoni’s CSK reached the final for a record 8th time in 2019 but was stopped by a resurgent Mumbai Indians
        side which won the final by a whisker.
        Under MS Dhoni’s captaincy, in IPL 2021 final CSK beats KKR by 27 runs and won the trophy for the fourth time.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="high">ODI Career</span>
        <br /><br />
        Dhoni arrived on the international stage when the Indian ODI team was struggling to find it’s
        Wicketkeeper-Batsman. We saw Rahul Dravid in the 2000s and then the arrival of wicket-keeper/batsman from the
        junior ranks such as Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik.

        But they didn’t fit the team combination well. Then came in Dhoni, who was picked for the ODI squad for the
        Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.
        Dhoni had the most disastrous start to a career which anyone can ever ask for. Getting run out for a duck on
        debut is the last thing you want. But, despite ordinary performances in his inaugural series against the
        Bangladesh cricket team, Dhoni was selected for the series against Pakistan. ‘

        Dhoni scored his first century in his fifth one-day international. He scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only 123
        deliveries. And thus began the Dhoni era.

        His last ODI inning came against New Zealand in the 2019 WC Semifinal where he ended his ODI journey in the same
        way he started–with a runout. Although there were speculations that MSD will stage a comeback after the 2020
        IPL, the unforeseeable circumstances due to COVID-19 ensured that MS Dhoni played his <strong> last
          international game without any farewell.</strong>
